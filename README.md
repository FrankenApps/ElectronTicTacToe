# TicTacToe
Simple Web TicTacToe built with html, jquery and js.

You can see the working page here:http://frankenapps.github.io/TicTacToe/

## The code
The code is in a very bad condition, at the time when I wrote it I did not know about any standards or how you would express a logic in code correctly, so don't bother reading through it. And have some fun playing the game...

## How to play
There are 3 options:

1. Two humans play against each other. That's simple: Select your color, name and who wants to start, and then click the fields alternately, until you get the message that one of you has won, or that there is a draw.

2. Human against Computer. Tick one of the checkboxes for Computer and then select if you, or the Computer should start. Of course you may change the colors and names, too.

3. Computer vs Computer. Tick both of the checkboxes and change all the other settings if you wish to, and then hit the start game button, in order to see which computer wins. Of course the Computer who starts all the time will have a higher quota than the other one.
