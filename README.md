# ApeMemoryGame

This is a little web project with Javascript and Jquery. You must try to remember the Numbers, that are then hidden by the white squares. Your task is to remember where each number was and click on the corresponding square. You can look up the score of chimpanzees in that game and try to beat them.

Note: Should be more or less working now, but you may find some bugs. Feel free to report them, so I can fix them.

## Installation

You will need node.js and electron installed on your machine.

1. Install electron: ```$ npm install -g electron-prebuilt```
2. Clone the Repo: ```$ git clone https://github.com/FrankenApps/ElectronApeMemoryGame```
3. Open the App: ```$ electron ElectronApeMemoryGame```

## The code

I know the code does violate some common standards. You can tell me about any mistakes I made, I am still in an early learning stage.

## The idea

Scientists at the university of kyoto created this as an experiment to test the cognitive skills of chimpanzees. When you search on YouTube you can find a video like "Chimp Beats Human", where you can see chimpanzees playing this game.

## The average score of humans and chimps

Here is the average score of humans and chimpanzees in this game, when played with 5 hidden digits (values are approximate, because I made the plot myself):
